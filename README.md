# Integrated Python Course
Integrated Python Course

# Introduction
The Integrated Python Course is a comprehensive, hands-on program designed to equip learners with a holistic mastery of Python across diverse domains. Starting with core Python programming, the course progresses through version control with Git, file operations (local and cloud-based with AWS S3 and Azure), data analytics, REST API development, and AI integration. It further explores extensive libraries like PyTorch, web frameworks (Django, Flask), business intelligence, statistical analysis with R, web scraping, desktop GUI applications, microservices, and cloud technologies (AWS Lambda, S3, NoSQL databases, SNS, SQS). This structured roadmap is ideal for beginners and professionals aiming to leverage Python for full-stack development, data science, AI, and cloud-based solutions.
